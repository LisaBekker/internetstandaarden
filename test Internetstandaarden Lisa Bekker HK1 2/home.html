                Hey guys, Okay I am not going to say sorry for not posting much. You just have to get used to my messy schedule. But hey maybe we can talk about something. Actually I do not know what to talk about. There are so many things to talk about. So many thoughts running through my mind every day every minute and yeah every second. Maybe we can talk about focus. Okay a small disclaimer you can laugh at me or whatever but I failed my exams last year. And it has probably something to do with that thing. Focus. Atleast my dad thinks so. Last week we were chatting about school and he got mad at me because I did not pay attention because of my lack of focus. Yes I admit focusing is a problem, But how can I focus on you when you are clearly a distraction? I do focus on my distractions and the worst thing is I have no control of it. I have no idea how you slip into my mind again and again and again. Lots of Love, Lisa
